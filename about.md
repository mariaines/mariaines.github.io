I'm a full-stack staff software engineer. I love solving problems as an IC, building tools & processes to level up my teams, and serving as a cross-team technical advisor & mentor.

I've worked on everything from scaling performant backends & APIs, to deployment pipelines and infrastructure-as-code, to frontend infrastructure and tooling, to responsive cross-platform clients.

I'm currently at [Seesaw](https://seesaw.com), the elementary learning experience platform.

Prior to Seesaw, I worked at Google on various projects related to expanding internet access in developing nations, culminating in [Nearby Collections](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview), a peer-to-peer networking API for Android.

In between, I had a stint as a graduate student in Math at [Oregon State University](https://math.oregonstate.edu/). I took courses in Real Analysis, Linear Algebra, and Computational Number Theory.

I graduated from [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science, concentration in Theory, in May 2012.
