I'm a full-stack software engineer living in the great city of Oakland, CA. I code primarily in python and javascript.

I'm currently at [Seesaw](https://web.seesaw.me), a platform for student engagement. We make apps for students, teachers, and families to engage in K-12 student learning.

In 2017 I took a break from the tech world to try my hand as a graduate student in Math at [Oregon State University](https://math.oregonstate.edu/). I took courses in Real Analysis, Linear Algebra, and Computational Number Theory.

Before that, I was at Google for 5 years. I worked on various projects related to expanding internet access in developing nations, culminating in [Nearby Collections](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview), a peer-to-peer networking API for Android.

I graduated from [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/) with a degree in Computer Science, Theory track, in May 2012.
